## Python Installation
If you don't have Python already you can fetch it easily from the Windows Store. Simply type `store` into the windows search bar, and select the latest version. At the time of writing that is Python 3.10.

If you install Python straight from `python.org` instead remember to click 'Add Python environmental variables', this is important.

Once you have Python continue with installation instructions. If you don't have a GIT client you can simply download the source files directly with the green `Code` button, enter the downloaded directory and from Powershell, `pip install .`

Now just run the `__main__.py` file with command `python .` or `pythonw .`
