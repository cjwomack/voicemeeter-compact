## Python Installation

If you don't have Python already you can fetch it easily from the Windows Store. Simply type `store` into the windows search bar. To run this GUI you'll need the latest version, Python 3.11 (Beta).

If you install Python straight from `python.org` instead remember to click 'Add Python environmental variables', this is important.

## Download|Install Code

Once Python is installed:

Enter voicemeeter-compact directory and type `powershell.exe` into the explorer bar as shown in the image below.

This will open a Powershell in the current directory.

Then use the command `pip install voicemeeter-compact` and wait for the required packages to install.

## Use

Finally, run the GUI with the command `pythonw .`

If the GUI looks like the image below when you first load it, then no channels are labelled. From the menu, Profiles->Load Profile you may load an example config. Save your current Voicemeeter settings first :).

steps above from [Download|Install Code](https://github.com/onyx-and-iris/voicemeeter-compact/blob/main/INSTALLATION.md#downloadinstall-code) onwards.
